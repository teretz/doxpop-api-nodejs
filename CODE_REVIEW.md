# Code Review Guidelines

## General Principles

1. **Readability**: Ensure the code is easy to read and understand.
2. **Simplicity**: Keep the code as simple as possible.
3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication.
4. **Comments**: Add meaningful comments to explain complex logic.

## Process

1. **Branching**: Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix.
2. **Peer Review**: Before merging, have at least one other team member review the code.
3. **Automated Tests**: Ensure all automated tests pass.
4. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual tests to ensure the code works as expected.
5. **Merge**: Once approved, merge the code into the main branch.

## Tools

- Use linters and formatters to maintain code style.
- Use version control (Git) to track changes.

## Best Practices

- Follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.
- Be respectful and constructive during the review process.

# Reusability and Extensibility Guidelines

## Reusability

1. **Modularization**: Break down the code into smaller, reusable modules.
2. **Functions**: Use functions to encapsulate reusable logic.
3. **Libraries**: Utilize libraries for common tasks.

## Extensibility

1. **Loose Coupling**: Design the code to be as independent as possible.
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Documentation**: Document how to extend existing functionalities.

## Tips

- Use design patterns where appropriate.
- Keep an eye on performance while designing for reusability and extensibility.
